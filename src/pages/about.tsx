              Hello! I'm Hung Nguyen. I'm a DevOps/SRE engineer
              from Vietnam.

            <Paragraph>
                ðŸ”­ After spending more than five years working in the mechanical engineering field at Intel Vietnam, 
                I decided it was time for a career change. During that time, I was focused on using LEAN principles and innovation 
                to improve operational efficiency, I notice how much the world was being transformed by software, 
                particularly in the mechanical industry. That realization led me to join an internal mentoring program in 2021, 
                where I had the opportunity to meet with a principal engineer of Intel's IoT Group from the US. 
                During our one-on-one meetings, we delved into the world of IoT and its related concepts, 
                including connectivity broadcasting, security, micro-services, and DevOps culture. 
                This experience was a turning point for me, as it inspired me to become a DevOps/SRE engineer and 
                work towards growing into roles such as MLOps/DataOps/AIOps. 
                <br /><br />
                ðŸŒ± This shift was more than a career pivotâ€”it marked the beginning of my specialization in cutting-edge areas like
                DevSecOps. My successful transition culminated at OPSWAT Vietnam, where I excelled as an SRE, 
                managing the Metadefender Cloud Platform/API. Here, my role not only deepened my expertise in cybersecurity and 
                infrastructure but also underscored my continuous research and development within the software field.
                <br /><br />
                ðŸ‘¯ One of the methods I've found to be particularly effective is sharing what I learn with others.  
                By doing so, not only am I able to better organize my own knowledge, but I'm also able to communicate 
                with others and reinforce my own understanding while correcting any misunderstandings along the way.
